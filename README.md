[See demo](https://kurilov.site)

## Installation

* First, Download the [latest release](https://github.com/anton0kurilov/mdsimple/releases/) directly from GitHub.

* You'll be presented with a number of files. The stuff you want to concern yourself with are index.html and folder /assets/img.

* Replace "Your name" and "Your Bio" with... your name and your bio.

* Edit the href value of the social links. Obviously, change the text of the tag, too. Go to [FontAwesome.io](http://fontawesome.io/icons/) and search icons for your social links. Edit ```fa fa-link``` on ```fa fa-SEARCHED```.

* Also very important in index.html is going to be the METADATA. Up inside the head tag, edit the dummy content in the meta tags with real data.

* Add a favicon from [https://realfavicongenerator.net](realfavicongenerator.net) to /assets/img directory. Remove avatar.png and put your image.

* That's all, HIT THAT (figurative) UPLOAD BUTTON!
